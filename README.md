Project planning and material repository for the 2024 challenge to generate 1 PB
of OME-Zarr data.

**UPDATE (20th October 2024)**: The data converted for the challenge can now be
browsed and searched at
[https://ome.github.io/ome2024-ngff-challenge/](https://ome.github.io/ome2024-ngff-challenge/).

## Challenge overview

The high-level goal of the challenge is to generate OME-Zarr data according to a
development version of the specification to drive forward the implementation
work and establish a baseline for the conversion costs that members of the
community can expect to incur.

Data generated within the challenge will have:

- all v2 arrays converted to v3, optionally sharding the data
- all .zattrs metadata migrated to `zarr.json["attributes"]["ome"]`
- a top-level `ro-crate-metadata.json` file with minimal metadata (specimen and
  imaging modality)

You can example the contents of a sample dataset by using
[the minio client](https://github.com/minio/mc):

```
$ mc alias set uk1anon https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk "" ""
Added `uk1anon` successfully.

<hr>

`4496763.json` was created with ome2024-ngff-challenge commit `0e1809bf3b`.

First the config details were generated with:

```
$ ome2024-ngff-challenge --input-bucket=idr --input-endpoint=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk --input-anon zarr/v0.4/idr0047A/4496763.zarr params_4496763.json --output-write-details
```

The `params_4496763.json` file was edited to set "shards" to:
`[4, 1, sizeY, sizeX]` for each pyramid resolution to create a single shard for
each Z section.

```
# params_4496763.json
[{"shape": [4, 25, 2048, 2048], "chunks": [1, 1, 2048, 2048], "shards": [4, 1, 2048, 2048]}, {"shape": [4, 25, 1024, 1024], "chunks": [1, 1, 1024, 1024], "shards": [4, 1, 1024, 1024]}, {"shape": [4, 25, 512, 512], "chunks": [1, 1, 512, 512], "shards": [4, 1, 512, 512]}, {"shape": [4, 25, 256, 256], "chunks": [1, 1, 256, 256], "shards": [4, 1, 256, 256]}, {"shape": [4, 25, 128, 128], "chunks": [1, 1, 128, 128], "shards": [4, 1, 128, 128]}, {"shape": [4, 25, 64, 64], "chunks": [1, 1, 64, 64], "shards": [4, 1, 64, 64]}]
```

This was then used to run the conversion:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge --input-bucket=idr --input-endpoint=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk --input-anon zarr/v0.4/idr0047A/4496763.zarr 4496763.zarr --output-read-details params_4496763.json
```

<hr>

`9822152.zarr` was created with ome2024-ngff-challenge commit `f17a6de963`.

The chunks and shard shapes are specified to be the same for all resolution
levels. This is required since the smaller resolution levels of the source image
at
https://ome.github.io/ome-ngff-validator/?source=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk/idr/zarr/v0.4/idr0083A/9822152.zarr
have chunks that correspond to the resolution shape, e,g, `1,1,1,91,141` and
this will fail to convert using a shard shape of `1,1,1,4096,4096`.

Took 34 minutes to run conversion with this command:

```
$ ome2024-ngff-challenge --input-bucket=idr --input-endpoint=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk --input-anon zarr/v0.4/idr0083A/9822152.zarr 9822152.zarr --output-shards=1,1,1,4096,4096 --output-chunks=1,1,1,1024,1024 --log debug
```

<hr>

Took 9 hours to run this conversion (before multi-threading changes):

```
$ ome2024-ngff-challenge 9846151.zarr/0 will/9846151_2D_chunks_3.zarr --output-shards=1,1,1,4096,4096 --output-chunks=1,1,1,1024,1024 --log debug
```

<hr>

Plate conversion, took 19 minutes, choosing a shard size that contained a whole
image. Image shape is `1,3,1,1024,1280`.

```
$ ome2024-ngff-challenge --input-bucket=bia-integrator-data --input-endpoint=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk --input-anon S-BIAD847/0762bf96-4f01-454d-9b13-5c8438ea384f/0762bf96-4f01-454d-9b13-5c8438ea384f.zarr /data/will/idr0035/Week9_090907.zarr --output-shards=1,3,1,1024,2048 --output-chunks=1,1,1,1024,1024 --log debug
```

## CLI Commands

### `resave`: convert your data

The `ome2024-ngff-challenge` tool can be used to convert an OME-Zarr 0.4 dataset
that is based on Zarr v2. The input data will **not be modified** in any way and
a full copy of the data will be created at the chosen location.

#### Getting started

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr
```

is the most basic invocation of the tool. If you do not choose a license, the
application will fail with:

```
No license set. Choose one of the Creative Commons license (e.g., `--cc-by`) or skip RO-Crate creation (`--rocrate-skip`)
```

#### Licenses

There are several license options to choose from. We suggest one of:

- `--cc-by`: credit must be given to the creator
- `--cc0`: Add your data to the public domain

Alternatively, you can choose your own license, e.g.,

`--rocrate-license=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/`

to restrict commercial use of your data. Additionally, you can disable metadata
collection at all.

**Note:** you will need to add metadata later for your dataset to be considered
valid.

#### Metadata

There are four additional fields of metadata that are being collected for the
challenge:

- organism and modality: RECOMMENDED
- name and description: SUGGESTED

These can be set via the properties prefixed with `--rocrate-` since they will
be stored in the standard [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/) JSON file
(`./ro-crate-metadata.json`) at the top-level of the Zarr dataset.

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --rocrate-organism=NCBI:txid9606      # Human
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --rocrate-modality=obo:FBbi_00000369  # SPIM
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --rocrate-name="short name of dataset"
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --rocrate-description="and a longer description"
```

For other examples including several other NCBI and FBbi terms, please see:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --help
```

#### Re-running the script

If you would like to re-run the script with different parameters, you can
additionally set `--output-overwrite` to ignore a previous conversion:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --output-overwrite
```

#### Writing in parallel

By default, 16 chunks of data will be processed simultaneously in order to bound
memory usage. You can increase this number based on your local resources:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --output-threads=128
```

#### Reading/writing remotely

If you would like to avoid downloading and/or upload the Zarr datasets, you can
set S3 parameters on the command-line which will then treat the input and/or
output datasets as a prefix within an S3 bucket:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by \
        --input-bucket=BUCKET \
        --input-endpoint=HOST \
        --input-anon \
        input.zarr \
        output.zarr
```

A small example you can try yourself:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by \
        --input-bucket=idr \
        --input-endpoint=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk \
        --input-anon \
        zarr/v0.4/idr0062A/6001240.zarr \
        /tmp/6001240.zarr
```

#### Reading/writing via a script

Another R/W option is to have `resave.py` generate a script which you can
execute later. If you pass `--output-script`, then rather than generate the
arrays immediately, a file named `convert.sh` will be created which can be
executed later.

For example, running:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by dev2/input.zarr /tmp/scripts.zarr --output-script
```

produces a dataset with one `zarr.json` file and 3 `convert.sh` scripts:

```
/tmp/scripts.zarr/0/convert.sh
/tmp/scripts.zarr/1/convert.sh
/tmp/scripts.zarr/2/convert.sh
```

Each of the scripts contains a statement of the form:

```
zarrs_reencode --chunk-shape 1,1,275,271 --shard-shape 2,236,275,271 --dimension-names c,z,y,x --validate dev2/input.zarr /tmp/scripts.zarr
```

Running this script will require having installed `zarrs_tools` with:

```
cargo install zarrs_tools
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin
```

#### Optimizing chunks and shards

Zarr v3 supports shards, which are files that contain multiple chunks. The shape
of a shard must be a multiple of the chunk size in every dimension. There is not
yet a single heuristic for determining the chunk and shard sizes that will work
for all data. **The default shard shape chosen by resave is the full shape of
the image array.**

In order to limit the size of a shard, if the shard exceeds 100,000,000 pixels
then you must specify the shard-shape. You can specify the shard shape, using
--output-shards, which will be used for all pyramid resolutions. This may cause
issues if the chunk shape changes for lower resolutions (to match the smaller
image shape). In this case, you should also specify the chunk-shape to be used
for all resolutions:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --output-chunks=1,1,1,256,256 --output-shards=1,1,1,2048,2048
```

Alternatively, you can use a JSON file to review and manually optimize the
chunking and sharding parameters on a per-resolution basis:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr parameters.json --output-write-details
```

This will write a JSON file of the form:

```
[{"shape": [...], "chunks": [...], "shards": [...]}, ...
```

where the order of the dictionaries matches the order of the "datasets" field in
the "multiscales". Edits to this file can be read back in using the
`output-read-details` flag:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge resave --cc-by input.zarr output.zarr --output-read-details=parameters.json
```

Note: Changes to the shape are ignored.

#### More information

See `ome2024-ngff-challenge resave -h` for more arguments and examples.

### `lookup`: finding ontology terms (WIP)

The `ome2024-ngff-challenge` tool can also be used to look up terms from the EBI
OLS for setting metadata fields like `--rocrate-modality` and
`--rocrate-organism`:

```
ome2024-ngff-challenge lookup "homo sapiens"
ONTOLOGY  	TERM                	LABEL                         	DESCRIPTION
ncbitaxon 	NCBITaxon_9606      	Homo sapiens
vto       	VTO_0011993         	Homo sapiens
snomed    	SNOMED_337915000    	Homo sapiens
...
```
